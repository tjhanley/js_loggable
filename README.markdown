js\_loggable
============
Server Side Logging of Client JavaScript Errors
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes you have the need to suppress all client side javascript... but it would be nice to know if the are issues happening in production. _js\_loggable_ is designed trap any client side javascript errors and send them back to your application to log them         

Status
======
This is _not_ a functional plugin yet. I have the a ways to go before this is even Alpha. This will for sure break stuff if you install it.

TODO
======
• Make the javascript agnostic. Currently it is jQuery
• Have the partial with the js required included automatically in any template that gets rendered by an action
• Namespace the javascript functions


Example
=======
Controller you want to log javascript for
`class Blog < ApplicationController
  include JsLoggable
  layout "layout"
  
  log_javascript :index
  
  def index
  end
  
  def show
  end
  
end`

View that is generated
`<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
    function jsLoggableLogError(e) {
      try {
        $.post( '/js_loggable/new', { navigator: encodeURI(navigator.userAgent),
                                          timestamp: encodeURI(Date()),  
                                          errormsg: encodeURI(e),
                                          location: window.location }
               ); 
        return true;
      } catch(e) {
        // don't error 
        return true; 
      }
    }
  window.onerror = jsLoggableLogError;
  alert(james);
</script>

hello world`
